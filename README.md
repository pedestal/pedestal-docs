##  Contributing

If you wish to point out an issue in the site or propose a new page,
you can do so by filing a GitHub issue at
https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal-docs/issues

If you wish to make a contribution (typo, modification, or new

## Building the Site

The site is built using [JBake](http://jbake.org/).

See the JBake [download](https://jbake.org/download.html) site for installation instructions.

To build the site, you need side-by-side checkouts of Pedestal and Pedestal Docs.

Retrieve Pedestal and switch to a publicly-available version:

    git clone https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal.git pedestal
    cd pedestal
    git checkout 0.5.4
    cd .. # back out to the parent directory

To build the site:

Retrieve the content:

* `git clone https://github.com/pedestal/docs.git pedestal-docs` (or your own fork)
* `cd pedestal-docs`

Generate the pages:

* `jbake -b -s` - this will create the static site in the output
  directory, start a web server and watch for changes. The local site
  is available at http://localhost:8820/index.

### Only Needed When Pedestal Changes

Create the autogenerated material

* `clj -m samples`
* `script/gen-api-doc.sh`
