# Pedestal Docs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pedestal/pedestal-docs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pedestal/pedestal-docs)

This is an open-source repository of documentation for the
[Pedestal](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal) libraries.

## Get Started with Pedestal

[Read Pedestal Docs](http://pedestal.io)

##  Contributing

If you wish to point out an issue in the site or propose a new page,
you can do so by filing a GitHub issue at
https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal-docs/issues

If you wish to make a contribution (typo, modification, or new

## Building the Site

The site is built using [JBake](http://jbake.org/). JBake 2.5.0 is required.
Earlier versions don't work.

To install JBake 2.5.0-SNAPSHOT:

* `curl -O http://cdn.cognitect.com/clojure.org/jbake-2.5.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip`
  (or download this file with your browser)
* `unzip -o jbake-2.5.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip`
* Add jbake-2.5.0-SNAPSHOT/bin to your system PATH


To build the site, you need side-by-side checkouts of Pedestal and Pedestal Docs.

Retrieve Pedestal and switch to a publicly-available version:

    git clone https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal.git pedestal
    cd pedestal
    git checkout 0.5.3
    cd .. # back out to the parent directory

To build the site:

Retrieve the content:

* `git clone https://github.com/pedestal/docs.git pedestal-docs` (or your own fork)
* `cd pedestal-docs`

Generate the pages:

* `jbake` - this will create the static site in the output directory
* Run `jbake -s` to serve these pages at http://localhost:8820/index

To autogenerate the pages on change, we can use `entr`.

On Debian style Linux, install it with `sudo apt install entr`.

On Mac OS X with homebrew, install it with `brew install entr`

* Install the command `entr`.
* `find content templates assets | entr jbake`

### Only Needed When Pedestal Changes

Create the autogenerated material

* `boot index-samples`
* `script/gen-api-doc.sh`
