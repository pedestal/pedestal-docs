# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Pedestal documentation!

The pedestal/docs repository follows similar (but slightly different!)
guidelines to our other repositories; new content and substantial
changes still require a signed Contributor Agreement (CA), while typos
and other minor changes do not.

See below for more information on the CA process and how to submit
your own signed CA.

## Submissions

In general, we appreciate any and all submissions, but please remember
Pedestal is very much a work in progress; we may make changes that
invalidate certain submissions.

### Major changes

We'd like to ask that anyone considering putting forth a substantial
effort towards Pedestal documentation start that effort with a
conversation. Open an [issue](https://github.com/pedestal/docs/issues)
or send a message to the
[pedestal-dev](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/pedestal-dev) list
and let us know what you're working on.

While working on documentation we encourage you to ping the mailing
list frequently for feedback.

All substantial pull requests will require a signed [Contributor's Agreement](#contributors-agreement).

### Typos and other minor changes

You are welcome to open pull requests for small changes like typo
correction or grammar fixes without prior conversation.

We will generally accept these pull requests **without** a signed CA on file.

## Contributor's Agreement

When it comes to major contributions there is one more thing we need from
you: a signed contributor's agreement.

We know that a contributor's agreement can be a pain, but we want everyone
to be able to use Pedestal, including developers working on projects for very
large companies. Many of these big organizations care *a lot* about the provenance of
the code they use -- that is they need to know where the code came from and who owns it.
The contributor's agreement simply puts down in writing what we think is the
standard open source arrangement: Mostly it says that you are donating code that
you wrote to the project. By submitting a signed contributor's agreement,
you are helping to ensure that your work will be available to the largest possible audience.

It is an extra step, but there really is not much to executing the Pedestal contributor's agreement:
You just need to complete the following online agreement to assign copyright to Cognitect.
