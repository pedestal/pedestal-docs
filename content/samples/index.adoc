* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/aws-codestar-lambda[aws-codestar-lambda] - This is an example on running a Pedestal Service on AWS Lambda via API Gateway.
It's designed to be a https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/[CodeStar] project and ships with CodePipeline and CloudFormation support.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/buddy-auth[buddy-auth] - This sample demonstrates integration with
the https://funcool.github.io/buddy-auth/latest/[buddy-auth] library
using a Basic Authentication backend. In the process, it demonstrates
how to port buddy-auth's `wrap-authentication` and
`wrap-authorization` middleware functions to interceptors.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/chain-providers[chain-providers] - This sample demonstrates using Pedestal with a custom backend server.
Interceptor Chain Providers allow Pedestal to be used on top of any HTTP Server that's supported on the JVM.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/cors[cors] - Here we demonstrate an implementation 
of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[cross-origin resource sharing].
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/fast-pedestal[fast-pedestal] - This sample illustrates various techniques to reduce latency and increase throughput/goodput.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/hello-world[hello-world] - A bare-minimum Pedestal service that greets visitors.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/helloworld-metrics[helloworld-metrics] - Pedestal offers metrics logging capabilities starting with Pedestal-0.5.0.
The default metrics recorder publishes to JMX, but you can override that
behavior by setting the JVM Property `io.pedestal.log.defaultMetricsRecorder`
or the environment variable `PEDESTAL_METRICS_RECORDER`.
The value of the setting should be a namespaced symbol
that resolves to a 0-arity function or nil.
That function should return something that satisfies the MetricRecorder protocol.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/http2[http2] - This very simple app demonstrates using Jetty's HTTP2 capabilties.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/http2-conscrypt[http2-conscrypt] - This very simple app demonstrates using Jetty's HTTP2 capabilties.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/immutant[immutant] - This is the `hello-world` example, adpted to illustrate using http://immutant.org[Immutant].
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/jetty-web-sockets[jetty-web-sockets] - This sample illustrates how to use WebSockets with Pedestal and Jetty.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/nio[nio] - This sample demonstrates using a ByteBuffer as a response body. For large response
amidst a high number of concurrent connections, using NIO (via a ByteBuffer or
ReadableByteChannel) can increase your app's performance.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/ring-middleware[ring-middleware] - Pedestal incorporates existing ring middleware into its
interceptors functionality. In this example, we implement a service
that stores your name in the session via setting a session token
in the cookie store. We are depending on `ring.middleware.session.cookie`
for this functionality.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/server-sent-events[server-sent-events] - Demonstrates setting up, using and tearing down a server-sent-events
event stream. Events are sent from multiple threads.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/server-with-links[server-with-links] - This very simple app demonstrates generating a link
based on your application's routing table.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/servlet-filters-gzip[servlet-filters-gzip] - This sample shows how to use Servlet Filters and new Jetty Handlers
within your Pedestal services.
The sample specifically applies a gzip filter to the service configuration
of Jetty. To check on the encoding of the server's response,
hit with curl, requesting compression:
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/template-server[template-server] - Included (in no particular order):
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/tracing[tracing] - 
# Working with Distributed Tracing
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/tracing-interceptor[tracing-interceptor] - 
# Working with Distributed Tracing using Pedestal's Trace Interceptor
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/tracing-interceptor-aws[tracing-interceptor-aws] - 
# Working with Distributed Tracing using Pedestal's Trace Interceptor
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/war-example[war-example] - This sample shows the necessary tooling and options for building a deployable
WAR file.
