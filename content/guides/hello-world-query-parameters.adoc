== Welcome Back

Now that you've gone through the basics in link:hello-world[the Hello
World guide] it's time to go one level deeper. We're going to add two
features. That will be our vehicle to talk about some important
concepts in Pedestal.

== What You Will Learn

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

- Accept query parameters.
- Use the request map.
- Apply logic in your handler.
- Conditionally return an error.
- Return HTML in your response.

== Guide Assumptions

Like link:hello-world[Hello World], this guide is for beginners who
are new to Pedestal and may be new to Clojure. It doesn't assume any
prior experience with a Clojure-based web framework. You should be
familiar with the basics of HTTP: URLs, response codes, and content
types.

If you've already done some of those other things, you might want to
skip ahead to link:your-first-api[Your First API] to start building
some logic and multiple routes.

If you like to jump straight in to the deep end, you might be
interested in the link:crash-course[Pedestal Crash Course] which
assumes you know quite a bit about Clojure and web frameworks.

This guide also assumes that you are in a Unix-like development
environment, with Java installed. We've tested it on Mac OS X and
Linux (any flavor) with great results. We haven't yet tried it on the
Windows Subsystem for Linux, but would love to hear from you if you've
succeeded with it there.

== Getting Help If You're Stuck

We'll take this in small steps. If you get stuck at any point in this
guide, please submit an https://github.com/pedestal/docs/issues[issue]
about this guide or hop over to the
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pedestal-users[mailing list]
and raise your hand there.

== Where We Are Going

In this guide, we will build on the `hello.clj` example from last
time. We will enhance it to take a single parameter in the URL and
return a friendly greeting to that person.

There are some people we don't want to meet, though. So we'll also
include a list of names that should *not* be said. Then we can make
our handler function a bit smarter. If any forbidden name is uttered,
our handler will return a 404 response instead of a cordial greeting.

== Before We Begin

If you worked through link:hello-world[Hello World], then you already
have all the files you need. If not, take a moment to grab the sources
from
link:https://github.com/pedestal/docs/tree/master/content/guides[that guide].
That will be our starting point for enhancements this time.

== Accepting Parameters

HTTP offers a few different ways for the client to send data up to our
service. The most basic is probably the URL query parameter. We
usually see these on GET requests, but nothing stops a client from
using them on other request types.

.URL with Query Parameter
====
http://localhost:8890/greet?name=Michael
====

Because query parameters are so common, Pedestal handles them
automatically. You can try that URL with your service right now.

As a reminder, we're running the server by using
http://boot-clj.com[Boot] to start an interactive session (called a
REPL, rhymes with ripple) then starting the service in that session:

----
$ boot repl
nREPL server started on port 37569 on host 127.0.0.1 - nrepl://127.0.0.1:37569
REPL-y 0.3.7, nREPL 0.2.12
Clojure 1.9.0-alpha10

        Exit: Control+D or (exit) or (quit)
    Commands: (user/help)
        Docs: (doc function-name-here)
              (find-doc "part-of-name-here")
Find by Name: (find-name "part-of-name-here")
      Source: (source function-name-here)
     Javadoc: (javadoc java-object-or-class-here)
    Examples from clojuredocs.org: [clojuredocs or cdoc]
              (user/clojuredocs name-here)
              (user/clojuredocs "ns-here" "name-here")
boot.user=> (require 'hello)
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
nil
boot.user=> (hello/start)
----

Then from another window, we can send a request

----
$ curl -i http://localhost:8890/greet?name=Michael
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 22 Aug 2016 14:23:41 GMT
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Type: text/plain
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(9.3.8.v20160314)

Hello, world!
----

Even though we added a query parameter to our request, Pedestal still
found the right route and invoked our `respond-hello` function. So
where did the parameter go? To answer that we have to talk about the
mysterious `request` argument to the handler.

== The Request Map

Here's a reminder of what `respond-hello` looks like:

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
----
include::hello/src/hello.clj[tags=response]
----
<1> The function takes one argument, which we call `request`
<2> And it returns a map.

We aren't using the request argument right now, so we don't really
know what it is. (Well, it's probably not too hard to guess that it
has to do with the HTTP request that Pedestal received. From the title
of this section, you probably also deduced that it's a map!)

Let's take a look at that request by echoing it back to the
client. This is a common debugging trick that you can use.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
----
include::hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=response_debug_body]
----
<1> Instead of returning the string "Hello, world!" we return the _entire_ request as the response body.

Restart your service with that new definition and use curl. You'll see
something like this:

----
$ curl -i http://localhost:8890/greet?name=Michael
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 22 Aug 2016 14:35:11 GMT
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Type: application/edn
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(9.3.8.v20160314)

{:protocol "HTTP/1.1", :async-supported? true, :remote-addr "127.0.0.1", :params {:name "Michael"}, :servlet-response #object[org.eclipse.jetty.server.Response 0x49955795 "HTTP/1.1 200 \nDate: Mon, 22 Aug 2016 14:35:11 GMT\r\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains\r\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\r\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\r\nContent-Type: application/edn\r\n\r\n"], :servlet #object[io.pedestal.http.servlet.FnServlet 0x185fced4 "io.pedestal.http.servlet.FnServlet@185fced4"], :headers {"user-agent" "curl/7.47.0", "accept" "*/*", "host" "localhost:8890"}, :server-port 8890, :servlet-request #object[org.eclipse.jetty.server.Request 0x4b0f012d "Request(GET //localhost:8890/greet?name=Michael)@4b0f012d"], :query-params {:name "Michael"}, :path-info "/greet", :url-for #object[io.pedestal.http.route$url_for_routes$fn__11094 0x5d327c71 "io.pedestal.http.route$url_for_routes$fn__11094@5d327c71"], :uri "/greet", :server-name "localhost", :query-string "name=Michael", :path-params {}, :body #object[org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpInputOverHTTP 0x150ca6ce "HttpInputOverHTTP@150ca6ce[c=0,s=STREAM]"], :scheme :http, :request-method :get}
----

Yikes!

We need to unpack that a bit to make sense out of it. It's a Clojure
map, just printed all in one long line. I'll reformat it with some
line breaks. Syntax highlighting will help us read it too. Feel free
to paste this map into your favorite text editor with Clojure syntax
highlighting to pick it apart yourself.

I'm also going to omit some of the keys. They will be relevant later,
but they're not interesting now. And anyway, they don't print very
readably because they're objects rather than data.

Here's what we are left with.

[source,clojure]
----
{
 :protocol         "HTTP/1.1",
 :async-supported? true,
 :remote-addr      "127.0.0.1",
 :path-info        "/greet",
 :uri              "/greet",
 :query-string     "name=Michael",
 :query-params     {:name "Michael"},
 :params           {:name "Michael"},
 :headers          {"user-agent" "curl/7.47.0", "accept" "*/*", "host" "localhost:8890"},
 :server-port      8890,
 :server-name      "localhost",
 :path-params      {},
 :scheme           :http,
 :request-method   :get
}
----

This is a _request map_. It really is just a Clojure map. You access
its values with `get` and `get-in`. All the gory details about request
maps are in the link:../reference/request-map[reference section]. For
now, we'll look at three interesting keys.

The whole query string appears under the `:query-string` key. That's
the portion of the URL after, but not including, the '?'
character. The query string can be a pain to deal with. It is
URL-encoded and may have multiple parameters with delimiters. Pedestal
slices that up into a map of parameters for you, which is attached to
the `:query-params` key. Each parameter name gets turned into a
keyword. Parameter values are always strings, though, so you may still
have to parse them a bit.

You see that `:params` duplicates the same map as
`:query-params`. Pedestal merges all the different kinds of parameters
into one map for convenience. Most of the time, I know when I want a
query parameter so I just use `:query-params`, though.

== Using the Parameter

Inside our handler function, the `:name` parameter is available inside
a nested map. Let's dig it out and add it to our response.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=response]
----
<1> Extract the parameter, bind it to the name `nm`.
<2> For the response body, concatenate "Hello," and the parameter into a string.

Here we can just grab the value right out of the map and use it in the
response.

(You might notice that I'm using `nm` instead of spelling out
`name`. That's because I've been bitten many times in the past by a
subtle issue. There is a core function called `name`. If I ever change
my mind about what to call the parameter, I might end up using
`greeter` in one place but forget and leave `name` in another
place. In that case, I'd be returning a stringified respresentation of
_the `clojure.core/name` function_ instead of my parameter value! I've
done this often enough that I just avoid shadowing core library
symbols as a policy.)

Restart your service and use curl to try a few different requests with parameters.

----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=Michael
Hello, Michael
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=Pankaj
Hello, Pankaj
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=Geeta
Hello, Geeta
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=ไอรีนซีพีชาไอที
Hello, ไอรีนซีพีชาไอที
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=No%20One%20To%20Be%20Trifled%20With
Hello, No One To Be Trifled With
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=
Hello,
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet
Hello,
----

Dang. We were doing really well right up until the end
there. Obviously we need to do something smarter when the input is
missing. Bad user input is a way of life on the web, so let's not make
an error out of this. Instead, we just won't personalize the greeting.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=response_logic]
----
<1> Both nil and a zero-length string count as empty.
<2> This is our fallback response.
<3> And our personalized greeting.
<4> Generating the response.

Let's try that again:

----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet
Hello, world!
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=
Hello, world!
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=ไอรีนซีพีชาไอที
Hello, ไอรีนซีพีชาไอที
----

Much better! But our handler function is getting a bit unwieldy. I
don't mean that it is a whole six lines long, but rather that it mixes
too many concerns. This function parses inputs, applies "domain"
logic, and deals with creating a response body. It would be better to
refactor this to separate those concerns.


[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=response_logic_refactor]
----
<1> This function can generate any "OK" result.
<2> Our logic is now separated.
<3> The handler now coordinates the rest.

This version separates the concerns nicely. One big benefit is that
the `greeting-for` function is now easier to test. It's just a pure
function that doesn't require any HTTP muckery to exercise. Likewise,
that `ok` function is quite easy to test. Both functions are likely to
get more complex, but each one will only deal with it's own
complexity.

In this example, we're treating the case of an empty name the same as
if the name parameter just isn't included. See if you can make the
handler more strict so it will return a "400 Bad Request" response if
the name parameter is present but zero length.

== Conditional Responses

There are some names that should not be spoken. Let's enhance our
service to avoid them. This will be a relatively simple change. We can
hardcode the names as a set, then use that set as a function. (Clojure
sets are functions that test for the presence of their argument in the
set itself.)

This part needs to go before `greeting-for` because we'll use it to
make a decision in that function.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=not_to_be_named]
----

Now we need to think about our greeting function. Right now it returns
a string. We want to make sure the user gets a 404 if the query names
one of the forbidden ones. We could have `greeting-for` directly
return the response map, but that starts to entangle the concerns we
just factored out. We'll do the simplest thing that could possibly
work: is `greeting-for` returns `nil`, that means the request failed.


[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=greeting_with_404]
----

Because there are now three possible conditions that can happen in
`respond-hello`, I've changed from an `if` to a `cond`
expression. `cond` uses pairs of "condition / value" clauses. So if
`(unmentionables nm)` returns any truthy value, then cond returns the
`nil` and stops evaluating. If `(empty? nm)` returns true, then cond
returns the literal string "Hello, world!\n" and nothing else. If
neither of those happened, then cond sees the keyword `:else` as a
condition. There's actually nothing special about `:else`... any
truthy value will do. `:else` is just a convention. Then we build the
string the same way as before.

A nested `if` would also have worked here. In fact `cond` is a macro
that expands into a series of nested `if` expressions. All three of
these conditions are kind of parallel in significance, so I like that
they appear to be parallel in the structure of the code. The shape of
the code mirrors the shape of my thinking about these cases.

The second thing you'll notice is that the handler now makes a
decision whether to call our `ok` helper or the new function
`not-found`. I do hope you weren't expecting much in `not-found`! It's
as simple as it gets.

Restart your service and give it a try:

----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=Michael
Hello, Michael
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=Rumplestiltskin
Not found
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=曹操
Not found
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=voldemort
Hello, voldemort
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet?name=He%20who%20must%20not%20be%20named
Hello, He who must not be named
----

Looks like it mostly works, though it has some trouble with different
capitalization. Take a look at the docs for http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.string-api.html[`clojure.string`] and see
if you can figure out how to make the comparison case-insensitive.

== The Whole Shebang

Once again, we built this thing in small steps, so it may seem like
there was a lot to deal with. The final product is still pretty small
though. Here's all the final code.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure,subs="-callouts"]
.src/hello.clj

include::hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=ns]

include::hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=not_to_be_named]

include::hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=greeting_with_404]

include::hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=routing]

include::hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=server]
----

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure,subs="-callouts"]
.build.boot
----
include::hello-query/build.boot[]

== The Path So Far

In this guide, we built upon link:hello-world[Hello World] to add:

* Query parameters
* General response functions
* "Domain" logic
* Conditional responses

We also learned about the link:../reference/request-map[request map]
and how to deal with bad user input.

== Where to Next?

So far, almost all our responses have been plain text. (When we
returned the request map in the body, the content type was actually
`application/edn` but we can ignore that for now.)

Plain text is ugly, so we want to be able to return HTML. Rich clients
don't like HTML so much, so we also want to return JSON sometimes. The
link:hello-world-content-types[next stop] on this trail looks at how
Pedestal handles content types and response bodies. This will be our
first taste of interceptors.
