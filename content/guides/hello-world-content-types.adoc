== Welcome Back

In the first two parts of this trail, we made a link:hello-world[very
basic service] and we enhanced it to
link:hello-world-query-parameters[accept a parameter].

Both of these returned their responses as plain text. Plain text is
ugly, so we want to be able to return HTML. Rich clients don't like
HTML so much, so we also want to return JSON sometimes. It's time to
see how Pedestal handles content types and response bodies. We will
also get our first taste of interceptors.

== What You Will Learn

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

- Add interceptors to routes.
- Use functions to create interceptors.
- Use the response map.
- Transform responses into other content types.

== Guide Assumptions

Like link:hello-world[Hello World], this guide is for beginners who
are new to Pedestal and may be new to Clojure. It doesn't assume any
prior experience with a Clojure-based web framework. You should be
familiar with the basics of HTTP: URLs, response codes, and content
types.

If you've already done some of those other things, you might want to
skip ahead to link:your-first-api[Your First API] to start building
some logic and multiple routes.

If you like to jump straight in to the deep end, you might be
interested in the link:crash-course[Pedestal Crash Course] which
assumes you know quite a bit about Clojure and web frameworks.

This guide also assumes that you are in a Unix-like development
environment, with Java installed. We've tested it on Mac OS X and
Linux (any flavor) with great results. We haven't yet tried it on the
Windows Subsystem for Linux, but would love to hear from you if you've
succeeded with it there.

== Getting Help if You're Stuck

We'll take this in small steps. If you get stuck at any point in this
guide, please submit an https://github.com/pedestal/docs/issues[issue]
about this guide or hop over to the
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pedestal-users[mailing list]
and raise your hand there.

== Where We Are Going

In this guide, we will build on the same `hello.clj` that we've built
up over the last two examples. We will enhance it to return a JSON
content body. Then we will add the ability to look at the client's
preferred content type and make a decision about what to return.

== Before We Begin

If you worked through link:hello-world-query-parameters[Hello World,
With Parameters], then you already have all the files you need. If
not, take a moment to grab the sources from the
link:hello-world-query-parameters#_the_whole_shebang[whole shebang] in
that guide.  Feel free to browse the complete sources in
https://github.com/pedestal/docs/tree/master/content/guides[the
repository], but be warned that the file contains all the versions
that we built up through the previous guide. You'll need to navigate
some magic comments to pare it down to just the final version.

== The Hard Way

Our first effort to deal with content types will be pretty
manual. This is to show you what goes on under the hood before we use
the handy built-in features that Pedestal offers. Don't worry, this
won't hurt too much. It'll also let us introduce the most important
concept in Pedestal: Interceptors.

Back in link:hello-world-query-parameters[Hello World, With Parameters],
we echoed an HTTP request back
as the response. That was pretty useful for debugging, and it will
come in handy for our next step. Since our `/greet` route is working
so nicely, let's make a general route to just echo requests back. Pop
open `hello.clj` and change the `routes` definition to this:

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
----
include::hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=routing]
----

You probably noticed that `routes` is created with a `def` not a
`defn`. `def` creates a var and binds a value to that var. Under the
jargon, that means it creates a new name in the namespace and attaches
a value. `defn` is a macro that essentially expands into `def` with a
`fn`, hence the name.

In practice, when you see a `def`, you should think "this is creating
a value, and values don't change." So it is with the routes. After
changing the routes, you will need to restart your service. (This is
purely a result of the way we've built things for this guide. There
are techniques that let you automatically reload routes during
development. We'll get to those in
link:developing-at-the-repl[Developing at the REPL].)

When you restarted your service, you probably got a nasty message from Clojure like:

 clojure.lang.Compiler$CompilerException: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to resolve symbol: echo in this context, compiling:(hello.clj:30:3)

That is a very precise way to say we forgot to define `echo` before using it. Let's do that now.

We're going to define `echo` differently than our handler function
`hello`. Instead of a simple handler function, we're going to define
an Interceptor.

== Interceptors

Interceptors are how Pedestal handles requests. Routing is done by
interceptors. Parsing query parameters is done by interceptors. Even
our `hello` handler function got wrapped up into an interceptor when
we put it in the route table. An interceptor is a data structure with
functions in it. Each function receives a
link:../reference/context-map[context map] and returns a
context map, as shown in this diagram.

image::../images/guides/interceptors.png[]

That context map contains the request map, the response map, and a
queue of interceptors that still need to be invoked.

An interceptors `enter` function is called on the way "down" the
queue. Each `enter` function will be called in order. As interceptors
are entered, they get pushed on to a stack to be called in reverse on
the way back "up". Once the interceptor queue is empty, the `leave`
functions are called from the stack. That means the `leave` functions
are called in reverse order, as shown below.

image::../images/guides/interceptor-stack.png[]

Handler functions, like our `respond-hello`, are special
cases. Pedestal can wrap a plain old Clojure function with an
interceptor that takes the request map out of the context map, passes
it to the function, and uses the return value of the function as the
response map. (That actually takes more words to explain in English
than it does in code!)

One important note here: As soon as _any_ interceptor attaches a
response to the context map, Pedestal considers the request
handled. Remaining interceptors won't be called, and only the ones
that are already on the stack will have their `:leave` functions
called. This is a "short-circuit" behavior like an early-exit in code.

My advice is to build your value in the context with `:enter`
functions, turn it into a response at the tail end of the interceptor
queue, and then refine the response map with defaults, headers, cookies,
and so on in `:leave` functions.

Every interceptor can also have an `error` function, but we don't need
to deal with those just yet.

== An Echo Interceptor

We're ready to define `echo` as an interceptor:

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
----
include::hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=echo]
----
<1> Interceptor names help with debugging.
<2> We're making an enter function.
<3> Take the request map out of the context map.
<4> Make a response map out of it.
<5> Attach the response to the context map, and return the new context map.

We normally wouldn't write this in such an expanded form, but I wanted
to show all the pieces one by one. Ultimately, we're just making a map
with the keys `:name` and `:enter`. When Pedestal sees this map in a
route, it turns the map into an Interceptor record for you.

We can try that interceptor out now. Bounce your service and use curl to exercise the `/echo` route:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/echo
{:protocol "HTTP/1.1", :async-supported? true, :remote-addr "127.0.0.1", :servlet-response #object[org.eclipse.jetty.server.Response 0x78a74616 "HTTP/1.1 200 \nDate: Wed, 24 Aug 2016 13:24:53 GMT\r\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains\r\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\r\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\r\nContent-Type: application/edn\r\n\r\n"], :servlet #object[io.pedestal.http.servlet.FnServlet 0x1d574b7c "io.pedestal.http.servlet.FnServlet@1d574b7c"], :headers {"user-agent" "curl/7.47.0", "accept" "*/*", "host" "localhost:8890"}, :server-port 8890, :servlet-request #object[org.eclipse.jetty.server.Request 0x7660b772 "Request(GET //localhost:8890/echo)@7660b772"], :path-info "/echo", :url-for #object[io.pedestal.http.route$url_for_routes$fn__11094 0x725f2d66 "io.pedestal.http.route$url_for_routes$fn__11094@725f2d66"], :uri "/echo", :server-name "localhost", :query-string nil, :path-params {}, :body #object[org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpInputOverHTTP 0x375dbd49 "HttpInputOverHTTP@375dbd49[c=0,s=STREAM]"], :scheme :http, :request-method :get}
----

This should look pretty familiar from link:hello-world-query-parameters[Hello World, With Parameters].

== From Routes to Interceptors

When Pedestal starts your service, it sets up some default
interceptors for you. That includes an interceptor that does the
routing. A router is just a specialized interceptor that looks at
parts of the request, decides which interceptors to invoke next, and
pushes those onto the queue.

That means any other interceptor can _also_ modify the queue! This is
one of the big benefits of using interceptors: the ability to make
dynamic decisions during request handling. That even includes the
ability to bypass interceptors on the way back up.

== Returning to Content Types

One of the most important default interceptors is the "servlet
interceptor". It is both a servlet and an interceptor. This is how
Pedestal interfaces with HTTP servers like Jetty and Tomcat. It is the
first interceptor in the queue. On the way up through its `leave`
function, it makes sure that every response has a content type. If you
don't set a content type header on your response, the servlet
interceptor will pick a content type based on what kind of thing you
return in the response body. This table shows the type mapping:

.Content Type Mapping
|===
| Object in :body                        | Content Type

| Byte array                             | application/octet-stream
| String                                 | text/plain
| Clojure collection                     | application/edn
| java.io.File                           | application/octet-stream
| java.io.InputStream                    | application/octet-stream
| java.nio.channels.ReadableByteChannel  | application/octet-stream
| java.nio.ByteBuffer                    | application/octet-stream
|===

It does a pretty good job, but it's not always right. You might notice
that "text/html" doesn't appear anywhere in that list. We can force
that by setting a content type header in our response, like this:

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=ok_html]
----
<1> Attach a header declaring the content type.

Let's see the result:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://localhost:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 24 Aug 2016 15:02:08 GMT
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Type: text/html
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(9.3.8.v20160314)

Hello, world!
----

As expected. But, something about that doesn't seem quite right. We're
completely ignoring HTTP content negotiation. The client might want
JSON instead of HTML. Or it might _want_ plain text. Or EDN. The
trouble is that the HTTP content negotiation spec is a royally
pain. Fortunately, Pedestal provides an interceptor to help.

link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.content-negotiation.html#var-negotiate-content[`io.pedestal.http.content-negotiation/negotiate-content`]
does the job. If you look at the docs, though, you'll see that is not
an interceptor, but rather a function that returns an interceptor.

This is a common pattern when you need to include some state or
customize the behavior of an interceptor. You pass arguments to a
function which returns an interceptor that "closes over" those
arguments. It returns a data structure that contains functions that
carry those arguments around with them.

Let's remove the content type header from `ok` and use this interceptor.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=ns,continuo]

include::hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=routing_conneg]
----
<1> We'll need this namespace soon to emit JSON responses.
<2> This is the content negotiation namespace for Pedestal.
<3> A short, picky list of content types we can emit.
<4> Notice this route now has a vector of interceptors to invoke.

We are using a new namespace here, which will eventually let us write JSON data. That namespace comes from a library that we haven't included before. So if you try to run this as is, you'll get an error like this:

 clojure.lang.Compiler$CompilerException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: Could not locate clojure/data/json__init.class or clojure/data/json.clj on classpath., compiling:(hello.clj:1:87)

That is how Clojure tells you it is missing a library. By looking at
the library's https://github.com/clojure/data.json[project page], we see that the latest stable release is
"0.2.6" (at least, it is when this guide is being written!). We can
add the library in the dependencies part of our `build.boot` file:

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.build.boot
----
include::hello-content/build.boot[]
----

Any time you change the dependencies, you will definitely need to
restart your service.

If you try this out, you'll notice that absolutely nothing
changed. That's because the content negotiation interceptor handles
the protocol, but it's up to you to do something about the result. The
interceptor runs the algorithm, then attaches the result to the
request. That result is then available throughout the rest of
processing. This is a great way to decompose your interceptors into
small pieces that can be plugged together.

It's up to our service code to return a different body format
depending on the accepted content type. It probably won't surprise you
that this is a job for another interceptor!

Here's our first stab at it.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=coerce_entangled]
----
<1> Get the result of the content negotiation interceptor. Use "text/plain" as a fallback in case no suitable match was found.
<2> Get the current response out of the context map, get the current body out of the response. This must have been created by a previous interceptor's `enter` or `leave` function.
<3> Translate the body according to the chosen content type.
<4> Create a new response by attaching headers and the coerced body.
<5> Return a new context by attaching the updated response.
<6> Tell Pedestal to put this interceptor at the head of the queue.

Why does this new interceptor go at the start of the vector? Take look
at the picture of the interceptors above. The first one in the vector
is called _first_ for the `enter` function but _last_ for the `leave`
function. We want this interceptor to get the last word on the
response body so it goes at the top. Turn the queue sideways to write
it as a vector, and the topmost interceptor is on the left. It only
takes a little bit to get used to this.

Let's try this out with curl. Restart your service and try sending in some curl requests with different "Accept" headers:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://localhost:8890/greet   # Don't specify any Accept header
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 25 Aug 2016 02:28:44 GMT
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Type: text/plain
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(9.3.8.v20160314)

Hello, world!
----

Notice the content type returned by our service was "text/plain." Let's try some others. Keep an eye on the "Content-Type" header in each response.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -H "Accept: text/html" http://localhost:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 25 Aug 2016 02:30:02 GMT
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Type: text/html
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(9.3.8.v20160314)

Hello, world!

$ curl -i -H "Accept: application/edn" http://localhost:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 25 Aug 2016 02:30:24 GMT
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Type: application/edn
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(9.3.8.v20160314)

"Hello, world!\n"

$ curl -i -H "Accept: application/xml, application/json" http://localhost:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 25 Aug 2016 02:30:58 GMT
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(9.3.8.v20160314)

"Hello, world!\n"
----

Very nice.

== Refactoring and Style

So our `coerce-body` interceptor works as intended. As usual, I've
written it in a fairly "non-compact" style so it is easier to see how
the parts work with Pedestal. I see a couple of things we can improve
though.

First, there's a straight-up bug. If a previous interceptor has
already defined a content type, we should respect that and not
overwrite the body or the headers. Second, we're attaching a new
headers map with _only_ the "Content-Type" header. Any other headers
attached by other interceptors will be lost. Finally, we could improve
the testability by factoring out some of the logic into pure
functions.

We're also going to touch up the `echo` interceptor while we're at it.

It is common style in Pedestal applications to make heavy use of the
core functions like `update` and `update-in`. They are good at taking
out a part of a nested data structure, applying a function to it, then
reattaching the updated part. Let's see how this interceptor would
change if we refactor it that way.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=coerce_refactored_comm;coerce_body_1;routes_refactored]
----

We're going to take one more step toward Clojure mastery. Do you see
the `coerce-body` function? It looks inside the context. If there's
already a "Content-Type" header on the response, then it does nothing
and returns the context without modification. On the other hand, if
there is no content type assigned yet, it modifies the context by
updating the response.

This is a really common pattern in functional languages. You want to
make a series of changes to a data structure, where each change is
conditional on some other logic. In an imperative language, this would
look like a series of `if` statements whose bodies each mutate the
object being built. In Clojure, they would look like a deeply nested
`if` special form, where each `if` returns either a modified or
unmodified version of the input. The trouble with deeply nested `if`s
is that it's too easy to get lost in the nesting.

Fortunately, since Clojure 1.5, we've had some macros to help with
that. The slightly tricky `cond->` macro is what we need here.
(That's read out loud as "cond arrow." Once you master it, you will
really level up in Clojure skills.) It is similar to the usual
threading macro `->`, but it applies conditions before threading the
expression. It expands to nested `if`s and `let`s that test the first
clause in each pair. If it evaluates to true, then it threads the
expression in the second clause. It looks like this:

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=coerce_body_2]
----
<1> This is the test clause. It says "if there is no Content-Type header"
<2> When the test is true, `cond->` puts `context` in the second position here, right after the `update-in`

If there were more clauses in the `cond->`, each clause would receive
the value returned from the previous clauses.

== The Whole Shebang

We're now getting a fair bit of code. This would be a good time to
think about splitting into namespaces for different
responsibilities. We'll tackle that some other time. For now, let's
take a look at the whole thing. Spend some time making sure you
understand how and when each line of code gets invoked.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure,subs="-callouts"]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=ns;continuo;coerce_refactored_comm;coerce_body_2;routes_refactored;server]
----


== The Path So Far

In this guide, we built upon link:hello-world-query-parameters[Hello World, With Parameters] to add:

* Rudimentary content negotiation.
* Response body transforms.

We also learned about interceptors and created a few.

== Where To Next?

The truth is that server-side applications don't vend out HTML nearly
as much as they once did. APIs are where it's at. In the
link:your-first-api[next guide] we will make a REST style API to serve
up wish lists.
