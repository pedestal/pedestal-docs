== What You Will Learn
After reading this guide you will be able to:

- Create a Component-based service using Pedestal.
- Test your service using Pedestal's test helpers.

== Guide Assumptions
This guide is for users who are familiar with Clojure, Pedestal,
Component and Boot. If you are new to Pedestal, you may want to go back to the
link:hello-world[Hello World guide]. If you're new to Component, you
should definitely https://github.com/stuartsierra/component[check it
out] first.

== Getting Help if You're Stuck
If you get stuck at any point in this guide, please submit an
https://github.com/pedestal/docs/issues[issue] about this guide or hop
over to the
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pedestal-users[mailing list]
and raise your hand there.

This guide shows fragments of code as we add them. Sometimes it helps
to see the whole thing at once, so you can always check out
<<_the_whole_shebang,the whole shebang>> at the end of this guide.

== Where We Are Going
In this guide, we're going to step through creating a Pedestal service
using Component. We'll start off by creating a Pedestal component and
wire it into a Component system map. We'll then proceed to testing our
service.

== Before We Begin
We'll limit our component's responsibilities to lifecycle management
of the Pedestal http server and provider. We'll also expose the
Pedestal service function (`:io.pedestal.http/service-fn`) upon
component initialization as a testing convenience.

Route or interceptor management will not be a component responsibility
because the management of routes/interceptors is more of an
application-specific concern. This may be familiar to you if you
studied the way the Pedestal _lein template_ lays out a Pedestal
service - routes, interceptors and configuration is kept separate from
service plumbing.

Finally, Pedestal service configuration, captured via a
link::service-map[Service Map], will be a component dependency.

Now that we have a better idea of what we want our component to do,
let's go build it!

== A Simple Pedestal Component
Create a `src` directory with a `pedestal.clj` file.

[source, clojure]
.src/pedestal.clj

----
include::component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=ns]
----
<1> Create a _pedestal_ namespace to house the Pedestal component.
<2> We need to require `com.stuartsierra.component` to implement the
`start` and `stop` `Lifecycle` methods.
<3> We need to require the `io.pedestal.http` for server creation,
starting and stopping.

Let's start implementing the component.
----
include::component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=component-init]
----
<1> Create a _Pedestal_ record. This record will contain a number of
 fields, the first field is _service-map_, which will hold the Pedestal
 service map component dependency.
<3> The _service_ field is created as part of the component
 initialization process.
<4> Include the _component/Lifecycle_ protocol since we'll be
implementing its methods next.

We'll first implement the `start` method. It will contain our
component initialization code.
----
include::component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=component-start]
----
<1> We're going to use
`link:http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/cond-%3E[cond->]` to
conditionally thread our service map through a number of
expressions. Each expression returns a modified service map.
<2> We'll always create a server. This will initialize the service
provider and configure the default interceptors.
<3> We'll _only_ start the server if we're not working with a test
system. More on `test?` in a minute.
<4> We'll always initialize the component with its state, an
initialized service map.

Once our component is initialized, we should not be able to
reinitialize it by invoking its `start` method. Therefore, if the
`service` field is set, we'll just return it. This makes our component
initialization code link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence[idempotent].

If you've read some of the other guides, this implementation should
look somewhat familiar. It's a combination of the server-specific code
used in the link:hello-world[Hello World] guide.

****
Before we go on, remember the `test?` function? It's idiomatic in
Pedestal services to include an `:env` key in the service map to communicate the environment of the service. This
currently does not affect the behavior of the service but it's a
useful marker. Our component will leverage this idiom and will not
start/stop the server if the service is configured for the test
environment. The implementation is included below.
----
include::component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=test?]
----
****

Now let's implement the `stop` method. It will contain our component
teardown code.
----
include::component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=component-stop]
----
<1> Like `start`, `stop` will be idempotent. If the component has been
initialized and we're not working with the test environment, we'll
pass the initialized service map to the stop function.
<2> Return the component with the _service_ field set to `nil`. You
can't use `dissoc` here since it would return a plain map, breaking
the component.

Now that we've got our component, we need a way to
initialize it. Let's tackle that next.
----
include::component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=constructor]
----
Our component constructor is just a wrapper around the map-specific
record constructor created by `defrecord`. The `defrecord` macro
creates a number of constructors and any of them could be used here. I
like to create my own wrapper around them since I typically perform
additional setup during component construction.

Now that we've got our Pedestal component, let's proceed to wiring it
into a full-fledged system.

== Wiring it up
Create a `routes.clj` file. This file will contain our routes and
handlers.

[source, clojure]
.src/routes.clj

----
include::component/src/routes.clj[tags=response]
----
The `respond-hello` handler returns a simple static response. It may
look familiar since it made its first appearance in
the link:hello-world[Hello World] guide.

Finally, let's implement the routes.
----
include::component/src/routes.clj[tags=routes]
----
We'll implement a single route, _/greet_, using Pedestal's tabular
routing syntax. In this case we're using `def` to create the var
`routes`. In some programs you may define a function, via `defn`, to create your
routes instead. This decision depends on whether route generation
needs to be parameterized. In this case, it does not.

Now that we've got our Pedestal Component and routes, we can wire
them up in a Component system map.

Create a `system.clj` file. This file will contain our system map and
system constructor.

[source, clojure]
.src/system.clj

----
include::component/src/system.clj[tags=ns]
----
<1> Require `com.stuartsierra.component`. It will be used to  to
create the Component system map.
<2> Require `reloaded.repl` for its system management functions.
<3> Require `io.pedestal.http` for the server _start_ and _stop_ functions.
<4> Require `pedestal` for the Pedestal component.
<5> Require `routes` for the application routes.

Let's create a system initialization function named _system_.
----
include::component/src/system.clj[tags=app]
----
<1> It will take the system environment as a single parameter. We'll
use keywords like `:prod` or `:test` for this.
<2> The system map will contain a `:service-map` key who's value is
a Pedestal service map.
<3> The system map's `:env` key will map to our environment keyword.
<4> We'll configure the service map with our app-specific routes.
<5> The system map will contain a `:pedestal` key who's value is an
uninitialized Pedestal component.
<6> The Pedestal component depends on a service map, so we will capture
that dependency with `component/using`.

== Running It
We'll use link:http://boot-clj.com/:[boot-clj] to run our
example. This should be familiar to you if you read through the
link:hello-world[Hello World] guide.

Let's create a `build.boot` file so that we can fire up a boot repl.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.build.boot
----
include::component/build.boot[]
----

From the project's root directory, fire up a repl, and start the system.
----
$ boot repl
...

design pattern ensures that the system is in the correct state no
matter how many times we do this.


== Testing
Let's move on to testing our new service. Recall that our service contains one
route, `/greet`. We'd like to verify that it returns the proper
greeting. Before we can jump in and do that, though, we need to create
some helpers. Some are just useful in general, while others are
specific to our component implementation. Don't worry, you won't have
to write too much code. Let's do it!

First create a `system_test.clj` file in the `src` directory.

[source, clojure]
.src/system_test.clj

----
include::component/src/system_test.clj[tags=ns]
----
The _system-test_ namespace requires all the dependencies
necessary for testing.

Now let's get to those helpers.

The `url-for` helper allows us to refer to routes by
_route-name_. I find this to be a very useful helper and use it in
every project.
----
include::component/src/system_test.clj[tags=url-for]
----
We need to expand the routes before invoking Pedestal's
`route/url-for-routes` function.

The `service-fn` helper extracts the Pedestal `::http/service-fn` from
the started system. This helper allows us to keep focus on our
tests rather than test initialization.
----
include::component/src/system_test.clj[tags=service-fn]
----

The `with-system` macro allows us to start/stop systems between test
executions. We'll model its design on macros like `with-open` and
`with-redefs` so that its shape and usage is familiar.
----
include::component/src/system_test.clj[tags=with-system]
----

Now that we've got our helpers implemented, let's move on to our
test. Create a test named `greeting-test`.
----
include::component/src/system_test.clj[tags=test]
----
<1> `sut` (for _system under test_) will be bound to the started
system by `with-system`. Notice how `:test` is passed as the system
environment key.
<2> Use the `service-fn` helper to extract the Pedestal service
function from the started system.
<3> Use Pedestal's `response-for` test helper to make a test request
to the `:greet` route. Use the `url-for` helper to refer to the route
by name.
<4> We should get back a '200' status.
<5> We should get back a response body of 'Hello, world!'

Now let's restart the repl and run our tests.
----
boot.user=> (require 'system-test)
nil
boot.user=> (clojure.test/run-tests 'system-test)

Testing system-test
[nREPL-worker-4] INFO io.pedestal.http - {:msg "GET /greet", :line 78}

Ran 1 tests containing 2 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
{:test 1, :pass 2, :fail 0, :error 0, :type :summary}
----

That's it! You now know the fundamentals necessary for implementing
and testing your Component-based Pedestal services.

== The Path So Far
At the beginning of this guide, we set out to create a Pedestal
component, demonstrate its usage as well as how to test it without
starting the http server. In the process, we also introduced a few general purpose
test helpers.

Keep in mind that Pedestal services are highly configurable. It's
important to separate that configuration from the core component
implementation. By limiting our component's responsibilities to http
server and Pedestal provider life cycle support, we can use it in a
wide variety of Pedestal implementations.

== What's next?
In a separate guide, link:pedestal-component-handlers-and-dependencies[Pedestal
Component: Handlers and Dependencies], we'll demonstrate how to introduce
dependencies and make them accessible to our handlers.

== In the wild
There are a number of implementations of Pedestal components in the
wild. Here are some examples. Be sure to check them out!

1. Stuart Sierra's
link:https://github.com/stuartsierra/component.pedestal[component.pedestal] repository
explores using Pedestal with Component and provides some great ideas
on how to make your component dependencies visible to Pedestal
interceptors and handlers.
2. Point Slope's
link:https://github.com/pointslope/elements[Elements] library
contains a Pedestal component based on some of the ideas implemented
in this guide. The implementation borrows the core ideas from 'component.pedestal'.
3. Michael Glaesemann's
link:https://github.com/grzm/component.pedestal[component.pedestal library], is a fork of
Stuart's
link:https://github.com/stuartsierra/component.pedestal[component.pedestal]
repository extended with helpers and separate components for the
Pedestal Server and Servlet.
