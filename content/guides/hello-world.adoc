== Welcome

We're glad you've decided to give Pedestal a try. We think it's pretty
powerful. Before we get into the heavy lifting though, we should start
with some basics.

== What You Will Learn

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

- Create a Pedestal project from scratch.
- Define a route.
- Return a page on that route.
- Return plain text in your response.

== Guide Assumptions

This guide is for beginners who are new to Pedestal. It doesn't assume
that you have any prior experience with Pedestal, Clojure, or any
other Clojure-based web framework. You should be familiar with the
basics of HTTP: URLs, response codes, and content types.

If you've already done some of those other things, you might want to
skip ahead to link:your-first-api[Your First API] to start building
some logic and multiple routes.

This guide also assumes that you are in a Unix-like development
environment, with Java installed. We've tested it on Mac OS X and
Linux (any flavor) with great results. We haven't yet tried it on the
Windows Subsystem for Linux, but would love to hear from you if you've
succeeded with it there.

We will be installing a tool to help manage dependencies and download
libraries. The one this guide uses is http://boot-clj.com[Boot]. Feel
free to take a look and install it now. We'll discuss it at the
appropriate time, so you can also wait until then.

== Getting Help If You're Stuck

We'll take this in small steps. If you get stuck at any point in this
guide, please submit an https://github.com/pedestal/docs/issues[issue]
about this guide or hop over to the
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pedestal-users[mailing list]
and raise your hand there.

This guide shows fragments of code as we add them. Sometimes it helps
to see the whole thing at once, so you can always check out
<<_the_whole_shebang,the whole shebang>> at the end of this guide.

== Where We Are Going

In this guide, we're going to take a series of small steps. We'll see
all the code to build a Pedestal service starting with an empty
directory.

The first time through, we will just do everything "by hand". This is
a little more work in typing (or copy-and-pasting) but it will let you
see how the pieces connect in the simplest possible use case.

== Before We Begin

Pedestal services are written in Clojure code, which you then run on a
Java Virtual Machine. You will need to have a Java Runtime Environment
installed on your computer. Let's make sure you're up to date. Fire up
a terminal and put in this command:

----
$ java -version
----

You should see some output like this:

----
openjdk version "1.8.0_91"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_91-8u91-b14-3ubuntu1~16.04.1-b14)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.91-b14, mixed mode)
----

Yours might vary in some of the details. For comparison, I'm running on
a http://linuxmint.org[Linux Mint] virtual machine.

The main thing is that I actually _got_ some output! If you get
"Command not found" or some variation of that, you probably need to
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/downloads/index.html#java[install
Java].

The second thing is to make sure that the Java version is at least
1.7.

OK, so now that you are ready to run Java applications, let's move on
to the Pedestal part.

== Starting From Scratch

We're going to start this project with an empty directory. In
practice, most of the time you'll generate a project from a
template. But for now, it's more important to see what the pieces are
and how they fit together.

I'm going to call my project 'hello-world'. Feel free to call yours
something different, but it's up to you to do the mental translation
in the rest of this guide.

----
$ mkdir hello-world
$ cd hello-world
----

A quick note on naming style. Clojure itself uses "kebab case" for its
names. That's lowercase words, separated with hyphens. When you have a
long name, it looks like the letters have been skewered. Hence, kebab
case. Since Clojure's own libraries use this style, most applications
and libraries do too.

We need a place to keep our code. By convention, that's in a "src"
directory:

----
$ mkdir src
----

== A Place to Put Things

Now we're going to create a file under "src" to hold our code. Call it
"src/hello.clj". It's going to start with a "namespace declaration". This
tell Clojure what namespace to put the code into. (If you're a Java
programmer, you can think of a namespace as similar to a package
name.)

[source, clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello/src/hello.clj[tags=ns]
----
<1> This namespace is called 'hello'. This almost always matches the filename.
<2> We need to use the 'io.pedestal.http' namespace, but would like to only type 'http' later in the file.
<3> We need to use the 'io.pedestal.http.route.definition' namespace, but would like to spell it as 'routes' later in the file.

This is very similar to using "import" in Java or "require" in
Ruby. It just makes some names from other namespaces available to us
in this namespace.

If you haven't written any Clojure before, this syntax might look a
little strange. The first thing that jumps out at people is the
parentheses. Why is there an open paren _before_ the "ns"? In Clojure,
every expression is enclosed in its very own set of parentheses. There
are no semicolons to end the line or curly braces to close an "if"
expression. To find the end of any expression, you just find the
matching paren.

The first thing in an expression is the function or a macro to call.
In this case `ns` is a macro that is built in to Clojure. It sets up a
namespace and makes the stuff we `require` available.

Speaking of the stuff we require, what is `io.pedestal.http` and
`io.pedestal.http.route`? Those are each namespaces from Pedestal
libraries. The
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html[`io.pedestal.http`]
namespace has functions that let you connect with HTTP servers, handle
requests, and send responses. The
link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html[`io.pedestal.http.route`]
namespace actually comes from a library dedicated to routing
(ingeniously named `pedestal.route`.)

Routing is split off into its own library because you can use it by
itself, or you can use the HTTP library with a different routing
layer. We won't need to do that in this guide, but other tutorials do
some pretty amazing things by substituting modules.

Also, don't worry about the indentation. Your editor might handle that
for you, but in any case, Clojure doesn't care about whitespace.

== Generating a Response

Whew. That was a lot to unpack from just the first three lines of
code! Let's pause for a moment to talk about the next steps. We're
making a web service that can say hello. That means we need to do some
basic things:

1. Listen to on a socket for HTTP requests.
2. Figure out what any given request means.
3. Make a response to that request.

We're going to do all of those things, but we're going to do them
_backwards_. In Clojure, you always find the most important,
highest-level functions at the _bottom_ of the file. Whenever I read a
Clojure source file, I start at the bottom and page upward. So the
next thing we're going to do is write a function that can return a
response to a "hello world" request.

[source, clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello/src/hello.clj[tags=response]
----
<1> Define a function called `hello` that takes one argument, which we will call `request`
<2> Return a map with two keys and two values.

A Clojure function returns the value of the last expression in the
function. In this case, that will be the map that we construct on line
2. This is in "map literal" syntax, which just means that we're
writing the whole map straight in the source code rather than building
it up by calling functions.

The map has two keys and their values:

* `:status` 200
* `:body`   "Hello, world!"

That's the whole thing. When our function returns that map, Pedestal
will translate that into a full HTTP response complete with content
type header and everything. (Later on, we'll see how to take control
of the whole response. For now we're just taking the easy road.)

There's absolutely nothing special about this map. It's a plain old
Clojure map. The _keys_ on the other hand, do mean something. They are
part of the "response map" specification, which you can
link:../reference/response-map[read about].

In fact, you can call this function without hooking it up to a socket
or route or anything. That's one of the beauties of working in
Pedestal... you can try everything interactively in a running
system. Let's do that before we move on.

== Managing Dependencies

Pedestal is built on the shoulders of giants, in the form of great
open source technology that many people have contributed to. That
gives us great power, but with great power comes great
dependencies. We could download all the jar files we need and string
together a classpath, but it's a huge pain. I just made a minimal
project and found 57 entries on the classpath.

This is why we _can_ have nice things, but it means we need some help
managing those dependencies. We're going to use help in the form of
http://boot-clj.com/[boot-clj]. Please take a few minutes to go follow
their https://github.com/boot-clj/boot#install[installation
instructions], then come back and we'll continue.

Now we can make a build file that tells boot what libraries our
service needs. This goes in the main directory `hello`:

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.build.boot
----
include::hello/build.boot[]
----
<1> Tell Boot where our source code lives
<2> Tell Boot we need three Pedestal libraries

We talked about `pedestal.service` and `pedestal.route` before, but we
have a new one here. Pedestal works with many different HTTP servers,
so we don't want the core library to depend on _all_ of the possible
servers out there. Instead, we let you decide which one to use by
adding the library for your chosen service. We're using
http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty] for this guide. It is a fast,
stable, and mature HTTP server. Best of all, it doesn't require any
installation ahead of time... we can start it up from inside our
service. That makes our service more self-contained and portable.

Let's try out our response function.

----
$ boot repl
nREPL server started on port 37569 on host 127.0.0.1 - nrepl://127.0.0.1:37569
REPL-y 0.3.7, nREPL 0.2.12
Clojure 1.9.0-alpha10
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_91-8u91-b14-3ubuntu1~16.04.1-b14
        Exit: Control+D or (exit) or (quit)
    Commands: (user/help)
        Docs: (doc function-name-here)
              (find-doc "part-of-name-here")
Find by Name: (find-name "part-of-name-here")
      Source: (source function-name-here)
     Javadoc: (javadoc java-object-or-class-here)
    Examples from clojuredocs.org: [clojuredocs or cdoc]
              (user/clojuredocs name-here)
              (user/clojuredocs "ns-here" "name-here")
boot.user=>
----

It's pretty safe to ignore all that output for now. The main thing to
look for is the prompt that says `boot.user=>`. That shows you can
input Clojure code to evaluate it (turn it into a value) and that
you're currently in the `boot.user` namespace. We need to tell Clojure about our `hello` namespace:

----
boot.user=> (require 'hello)
nil
boot.user=>
----

So Clojure apparently just burped 'nil' at us and came back to the
prompt. Believe it or not, that means it worked. The `require`
function returns nil, which Clojure printed for us.

If you get a message like these:

 clojure.lang.Compiler$CompilerException: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to resolve symbol: hello in this context, compiling:(/tmp/boot.user164143164117124931.clj:1:1)
 Unable to resolve symbol: hello in this context

It means you missed the single-quote before "hello" in the require.

You can check to see if your function got loaded:

----
boot.user=> hello/respond-hello
#object[hello$respond_hello 0x2db5083a "hello$respond_hello@2db5083a"]
----

This arcane output tells us that the symbol `respond-hello` in the
namespace `hello` is an object. It happens to be function object. Why
did Clojure print a function object at us? Because we told it to
evaluate the symbol, when we probably wanted it to call the
function. Like http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2491[Batman], our symbol
had no parens.

----
boot.user=> (hello/respond-hello {})
{:status 200, :body "Hello, world!"}
----

Well, we got the singularly unexciting result that we can call a
function and it returns the map that we told it to. Let's move on to
hooking this up to a route.

== Routes

In Pedestal, routing is the process of matching an incoming request to
a handler or chain of handlers. In link:what-is-an-interceptor[another
guide], we'll talk much more about what goes in those handlers. For
the time being, we can just use our function as a handler.

Let's tell Pedestal that we want the route "/greet" to map to our
handler function:

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello/src/hello.clj[tags=routing]
----
<1> We specify routes in a short notation, but they must be expanded and turned into a Router for use.
<2> This is the "table syntax". There are link:../reference/defining-routes[others available].

This one route says that incoming HTTP GET requests with the query
string '/greet' should call the function `respond-hello`, and that
we're naming this route `:greet`. Every route must have a unique
name. Sometimes Pedestal can automatically assign a name for your
route, but we'll get to that later.

We still haven't hooked this up to an HTTP server, but we can still do some testing by hand:

----
boot.user=> (require :reload 'hello)
nil
boot.user=> (require '[io.pedestal.http.route :as route])
nil
boot.user=> (route/try-routing-for hello/routes :prefix-tree "/greet" :get)
{:path "/greet", :method :get, :path-re #"/\Qgreet\E", :path-parts ["greet"], :interceptors [#Interceptor{:name }], :route-name :greet, :path-params {}, :io.pedestal.http.route.prefix-tree/satisfies-constraints? #object[clojure.core$constantly$fn__6443 0x6182d451 "clojure.core$constantly$fn__6443@6182d451"]}
boot.user=> (route/try-routing-for hello/routes :prefix-tree "/greet" :post)
nil
boot.user=> (route/try-routing-for hello/routes :prefix-tree "/greet" :put)
nil
----

The first thing we need to do is tell Clojure to reload the latest
code from `hello.clj`. That's what the `:reload` keyword does in the
`require` call. Without that, you'll get an "cannot resolve symbol"
error when you try to reference `hello/routes`.

The function `try-routing-for` lets us ask "What would Pedestal do?"
with an incoming HTTP request. We gave it our table of one route, a
magic keyword `:prefix-tree`, then the query string and HTTP verb.

When there's a match, `try-routing-for` returns the route that
succeeded. When there's no match, it returns nil. So the output shows
that a GET to "/greet" will be match, but a PUT or POST will not. When
no route matches, Pedestal returns a 404 response.

You might also notice that the output on the matching route has a
bunch of stuff that wasn't there in our input to `expand-routes`. In
fact, it is exactly the job of `expand-routes` to add all that extra
stuff that Pedestal needs but we don't want to type.

== Hooking It All Up

We're ready for that last step: connecting everything to an HTTP
server. That's one more function (at the end of the file) to create
the server.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::hello/src/hello.clj[tags=server]
----
<1> `io.pedestal.http/create-server` is a convenience function that builds everything in one step.
<2> This is where we tell Pedestal which routes to use for this service.
<3> We tell Pedestal that we want to use Jetty as our HTTP responder.
<4> Port 8080 is so boring. We'll use something different, but not _too_ different.
<5> Let's not block the thread that starts the web server.
<6> Start the server. This will return an initialized service map for the started service.

All we need to do now is run it.

----
boot.user=> (require :reload 'hello)
nil
boot.user=> (def hello-service (hello/start))
----

Jetty is now running and listening for connections. We've started the
service and bound the started service map to the `hello-service`
var which allows us to gracefully stop it later. Flip to a
different window and try curl or use a browser to hit
http://127.0.0.1:8890/greet.

----
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 19 Aug 2016 20:27:06 GMT
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Type: text/plain
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(9.3.8.v20160314)

Hello, world!
----

It's alive! Treat yourself to a hot beverage and a high five. Whenever
you get tired of poking it, just run `(hello/stop hello-service)` in
the terminal that is running the server to kill it.

== The Whole Shebang

This might seem complicated because I've used so many words to
describe all this. The code is pretty short though. For reference, and
in case you've hit any snags along the way, here are the complete
contents of both files.

[[app-listing]]
[source,clojure,subs="-callouts"]

include::hello/src/hello.clj[tags=server]
----

[[app-listing]]

.build.boot
----
include::hello/build.boot[]
----

You can also see all the code in the Github repository for
link:https://github.com/pedestal/docs/tree/master/content/guides[this guide].

== The Path So Far

We've covered a lot of ground in this guide. You have learned how to:

* Start a Pedestal project from scratch.
* Write a function to return a response.
* Define routes for Pedestal.
* Run a Jetty server that handles those routes.

Along the way you've also learned a bit of Clojure and some debugging
tricks.

== Where to Next?

The link:hello-world-query-parameters[next part] in this trail adds
the ability to receive a query parameter, apply logic to it, and
return a different response for an error.
