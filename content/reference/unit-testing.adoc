It is a good practice to separate core business logic from handler,
and more generally, interceptor code. This separation of concerns has
many benefits, including facilitating testing at the interceptor, interceptor
chain and end-to-end response generation levels.

== Testing interceptors in isolation

Interceptors can be tested in isolation by either directly invoking the
`:enter`, `:leave` or `:error` functions with a mock context map in your test
or by using the interceptor chain
link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.html#execute[`execute`]
function. Both approaches are demonstrated below.

Given the following interceptor:

[source,clojure]
----
(def widget-finder
     (interceptor/interceptor
      {:enter (fn [ctx]
                (assoc ctx :widget {:id 1 :title "foobar"} ))}))
----

We can test it either directly:

[source,clojure]
----
(let [test-fn (:enter widget-finder)]
  (is (= {:id 1 :title "foobar"} (:widget (test-fn {})))))
----

Or using the interceptor chain link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.html#execute[`execute`]
function:

[source,clojure]
----
(is (= {:id 1 :title "foobar"} (:widget (chain/execute {} [widget-finder]))))
----

We can extend this approach to test coordination across multiple interceptors as follows:

[source,clojure]
----
(def widget-renderer
  (interceptor/interceptor
   {:leave (fn [ctx]
             (if-let [widget (:widget ctx)]
               (assoc ctx :response {:status 200
                                     :body   (format "Widget ID %d, Title '%s'"
                                                     (:id widget)
                                                     (:title widget))})
               (assoc ctx :response {:status 404 :body "Not Found"})))}))

(is (= "Widget ID 1, Title 'foobar'"
       (get-in (chain/execute {} [widget-renderer widget-finder])
               [:response :body])))

== Testing your service with `response-for`

The value in exercising the end-to-end operation of your service endpoints is
that it provides quick feedback that you've wired things up correctly. Pedestal
provides the test helper
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.test.html#var-response-for[`response-for`]
utility function to facilitate testing of services without having to spin up an
http server.

The `response-for` helper function is specific to servlet-based
services and simulates the receipt of a servlet request and creation
of a servlet response. It takes a service function, verb and url as
required parameters while headers and a request body are
optional. Let us examine those parameters in more detail.

The _service function_ refers to the `:io.pedestal.http/service-fn` key
value assoc'd to the service map during service initialization.

The _verb_ is an HTTP method represented as a keyword (i.e., `:get`,
`:post`, `:delete`, etc...).

The _url_ is a relative url represented as a string.

The _headers_ and request _body_ inputs are optional and specified with the
`:headers` and `:body` keys, respectively.

=== Usage

Before using `response-for` in tests, a test service must be
created. This is done by calling `io.pedestal.http/create-servlet`
with the service map as a parameter. The resulting service-fn can be
bound to a var and used in subsequent tests.

[source,clojure]
----
(def service (:io.pedestal.http/service-fn (io.pedestal.http/create-servlet service-map)))
----

==== Testing GET

The following example illustrates a simple execution of `response-for`
within a test:

[source,clojure]
----
(is (= "Hello!" (:body (response-for service :get "/hello"))))
----

The response returned by `response-for` contains `:status`, `:body`
and `:header` keys. The value of the `:headers` key is a map with
stringified keys. Testing header values would look something like
this:

[source,clojure]
----
(is (= "text/plain"
       (get-in (response-for service :get "/hello") [:headers "Content-Type"])))
----

==== Testing POST

POST'ing to a service endpoint can be tested by using the `:post` verb
and specifying a request `:body`. The route under test typically
includes the
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.body-params.html#var-body-params[`body-params`]
interceptor to support request payload parsing. Therefore, you will
need to set the `Content-Type` header of the test request to the
appropriate value based on the payload format of the request body.

[source,clojure]
----
(is (= 200 (:status (response-for service
                                  :post "/foo"
                                  :headers {"Content-Type" "application/json"}
                                  :body "{\"foo\":\"bar\"}"))))
----
[source,clojure]
----
(is (= 200 (:status (response-for service
                                  :post "/foo-login"
                                  :headers {"Content-Type" "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}
                                  :body "username=test@test.com&password=my-pwd"))))
----

Notice how `Content-Type` is a string.

==== Constructing urls

It is recommended to create a `url-for` test helper based on your routes and
use that to create the relative urls for your tests. This allows you to
refer to routes by name as opposed to hard-coded paths. Route names
are typically more stable. Aside from that, it makes it easy to test
routes which use query or path parameters.

Here's an example:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[io.pedestal.http.route :as http.routes])

(def routes #{["/user/:id/items" :post `user-items]}

(def url-for (http.routes/url-for-routes (http.routes/expand-routes routes))))

(is (= 200 (:status (response-for service
                                  :get (url-for ::user-items
                                                 :path-params {:id 1}
                                                 :query-params {:sort "ASC"})))))
----

==== Testing Async interactions

Nothing special needs to be done when testing routes which include
async interactions. The `response-for` helper forces asynchronous
request processing to synchronous processing for test purposes.
