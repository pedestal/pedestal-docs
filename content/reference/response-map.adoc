== Description

The response map is attached to the link:context-map[Context Map] by any
interceptor in the interceptor chain. The response map describes the outgoing
HTTP response. If no response map is attached to the context by the time
processing is done or the attached response map is not valid, Pedestal generates a 404 response.
