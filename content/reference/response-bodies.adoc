This reference describes how the link:servlet-interceptor[servlet interceptor] handles
response bodies of various types. Much of this behavior depends on the
protocols `WritableBody` and `WritableBodyAsync`. See
link:important-protocols[Important Protocols] for details about those.

The exact handling of the response body depends on the Java or Clojure
type of the value in the `:body` key of the link:response-map[response
map].

|===
| Type | Default content type | Serialization | Async?

| byte array | application/octet-stream | direct byte copy | no
| string     | text/plain               | bytes according to platform's default character encoding | no
| Clojure collection | application/edn  | text representation of data, same as Clojure's writer | no
| Clojure function   | nil              | depends on the function                               | no
| File               | application/octet-stream | bytes of the file copied to the output stream | no
| InputStream        | application/octet-stream | bytes of the input stream copied to the output stream | no
| ReadableByteChannel (NIO) | application/octet-stream | bytes of the channel copied to the output stream | yes
| ByteBuffer (NIO) | application/octet-stream | bytes of the buffer copied to the output stream | yes
| core.async channel | nil | see below | yes
|===

When a core.async channel delivers a message, that message is written
to the stream, using any of the synchronous dispatches above. The
message from the channel must not be another channel. That's like
wishing for more wishes.
