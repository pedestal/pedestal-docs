HTTP allows clients to provide per-request information through several
mechanisms:

* The request URL
* Query parameters appended to the URL
* Body content

Various link:interceptors[interceptors] in Pedestal parse this
information and attach it to the link:request-map[request map]. Some
of these interceptors are link:default-interceptors[provided
automatically] by the
link:servlet-interceptor[servlet-interceptor]. Others require
application-specific information and must be created by application
code.

=== Query Parameters

The built-in routers all know how to extract query parameters from
URLs in requests. Any kind of request (i.e., any HTTP verb) can supply
query parameters.

Query parameters will be attached to the link:request-map[request map]
under the key `:query-params`. The value will be a map, constructed as follows:

* Each query parameter name becomes a key in the map.
* The query parameter name is URL-decoded.
* If the resulting string could be a Clojure keyword, it is converted to a keyword.
* Otherwise, the string itself becomes the key.
* The query parameter value is URL-decoded and attached as the value of that key.

For example, a request string like this:

----
/path/to/resource?after=123123%2099
----

Becomes the map:

[source,clojure]
----
{:after "123123 99"}
----

Whereas, the request string:

----
/path/to/resource?after:page=12&after:storyid=abc123XYZ&user%20id=99
----

Becomes the somewhat weird map:

[source,clojure]
----
{:after:page    "12"
 :after:storyid "abc123XYZ"
 :user id       "99"}
----

The odd-looking keywords `:after:page` and `:after:storyid` are legal
Clojure keywords, but definitely not an idiomatic usage. The keyword
`:user id` is even more unusual. Clojure keywords can include spaces,
but the Clojure reader cannot parse a keyword literal with spaces in
it.

Query parameters are also merged into the `:params` map inside the
link:request-map[request map].

Query parameters are a feature of the built in
link:routing-quick-reference#_routers[routers]. If you supply your own
router, it may or may not support query parameters.

=== Path Parameters

URL templating is popular with resource-oriented APIs. These use
segments of the URL, in lieu of query parameters, to supply
identifiers.

Pedestal calls these "path parameters". They are parsed from the URL
and bound to the `:path-params` map in the link:request-map[request
map].

Path parameters are always named by a keyword, which is taken from the URL fragment in the route. For example:

|===
| URL | Path param keys
| `/users`                 | none
| `/users/:id`             | `:id`
| `/users/:id/posts/:post` | `:id`, `:post`
|===

In every case, the value of the parameter is a string, taken from the
corresponding segment of the URL.

Path parameters are merged into the `:params` map inside the
link:request-map[request map].

Path parameters are a feature of the built in
link:routing-quick-reference#_routers[routers]. If you supply your own
router, it may or may not support path parameters.

=== Body Parameters

Pedestal can parse form data, JSON, EDN, and Transit data from request
bodies. The parsed information is called "body parameters."

Applications can also provider their own parsers for body parameter
data.

Different routes may use different body parameter formats.

For these reasons, Pedestal does _not_ automatically provide an
interceptor for body parameters. Instead, your application must add an
interceptor to routes.

The interceptor is created by the
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.body-params.html#var-body-params[`body-params`]
function. Without any arguments, it returns an interceptor that parses
according to the request's `Content-Type` header:

|===
| Content type | Parsed as | Coerce keys to keywords? | Bound to in request

| application/x-www-form-urlencoded
| HTML form
| Yes
| :form-params

| application/json
| JSON
| Yes
| :json-params

| application/transit+json
| Transit JSON encoding
| No
| :transit-params

| application/transit+msgpack
| Transit Msgpack encoding
| No
| :transit-params

| application/edn
| EDN data
| No
| :edn-params

|===

If the request has any other content type, the body will not be
altered and the request map will not be changed. That includes a `nil`
content type if the request just doesn't have a `Content-Type` header.

If you need to customize the way `body-params` handles content types,
or provide options to the built-in parsers, call it with a parser-map
as an argument. You can get a good starting point by calling
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.body-params.html#var-default-parser-map[`default-parser-map`].

One catch to note has to do with form parameters from an HTTP POST
request. Because form fields can be named just about anything, the
keys in these maps aren't automatically converted to keywords. If you
want them to be keywordized, you should make sure to have the
`keyword-params` interceptor on the applicable route.

==== File Upload

File upload is a special case of a request body. The request will have
a multipart body with separate encoding for each.

In this case, use an interceptor returned by the
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-multipart-params[`multipart-params`]
function. Use the `:store` option to persist the parts.

=== The Method Parameter

Browsers (especially older ones) do not have easy ways to handle
DELETE and PUT requests. Pedestal allows requests to "smuggle" a verb
through a query parameter.

If the magic query parameter `_method` is present, then its value will
be used as the HTTP verb for this request.

This substitution is handled by the default interceptor
link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-method-param[`method-param`]. It
occurs before routing, so you can use the correct verbs in your
routes.

Application code can generate links with verb smuggling via the
`:method-param` option to
link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-url-for-routes[`url-for-routes`].
