As documented in the
link:/reference/routing-quick-reference#_routers[Routing Quick Reference], 
Pedestal provides three routing implementations:
link:linear-search-router[Linear Search], link:prefix-tree-router[Prefix Tree]
and link:map-tree-router[Map Tree]. While the link:map-tree-router[Map Tree router] is the default router,
you can specify the router Pedestal uses by adding the
`:io.pedestal.http/router` key to the link:service-map[Service Map]
with one of the following keyword values:

- `:map-tree`
- `:prefix-tree`
- `:linear-search`
