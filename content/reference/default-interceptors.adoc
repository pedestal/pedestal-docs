== Description

If your <<service-map.adoc#,service map>> does not include the key
`:io.pedestal.http/interceptors`, then Pedestal will create a vector of
default interceptors for you.

The default interceptors are added to your service map when you call
either
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-create-servlet[`create-servlet`]
or
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-create-server[`create-server`].

This document explains which interceptors are added under different
conditions. Each interceptor has its own documentation that describes
its specific behavior.

== Modifying the Default Stack

If your <<service-map.adoc#,service map>> already includes the key
`:io.pedestal.http/interceptors` when you call one of the `create-`
functions, then Pedestal won't add the default interceptors. So what
should you do if you want to use the default interceptors, but want to
add your own interceptors to the default stack?

The solution is to call
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-default-interceptors[`default-interceptors`]
yourself, _before_ calling `create-server` or `create-servlet`. That
way, `default-interceptors` can build the default stack, then your
application code has an opportunity to modify it. By the time you call
`create-server` or `create-servlet`, the
`:io.pedestal.http/interceptors` key will have your modified version
of the default interceptors.

Here is an example of adding interceptors to perform authentication
and authorization on every request. (Assuming we have a namespace
`auth` with functions to construct these interceptors given a
configuration.)

[source,clojure]
----
(defn service
  [service-map authn-config authz-config]
  (-> service-map
      (http/default-interceptors)                                                 ;; <1>
      (update ::http/interceptors conj (auth/authentication-interceptor authn-config)) ;; <2>
      (update ::http/interceptors conj (auth/authorization-interceptor authz-config))  ;; <3>
      (http/create-server)))                                                      ;; <4>
----
<1> Attach the default interceptors to our service map
<2> Modify the defaults to add authentication.
<3> Further modify the defaults to add authorization.
<4> Create the server as usual. This would normally attach the defaults, but will skip that because we've set them up ourselves.


== Default Interceptors

Some of the default interceptors are conditional. Pedestal adds them
when other parts of the service map indicate a need for an
interceptor. These will be noted below.

These are presented in the order that they appear in the interceptor
vector. That means their `enter` functions will be called in the order
they appear in this document, and their `leave` functions are called
in reverse order.

=== link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-log-request[`log-request`]

Always added. Logs each request at `info` level. See link:logging[Logging]
to configure loggers and logging levels.

=== link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.cors.html#var-allow-origin[`allow-origin`]

Added when the service map has a value for `:io.pedestal.http/allowed-origins`.

=== link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-not-found-interceptor[`not-found`]

Always added. However, if the service map includes a value for
`:io.pedestal.http/not-found-interceptor`, then that interceptor will
be used in this position instead of the built-in.

=== link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-session[`session`]

Added when the service map has a value for
`:io.pedestal.http/enable-session` or `:io.pedestal.http/enable-csrf`.

=== link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.csrf.html#var-anti-forgery[`anti-forgery`]

Added when the service map includes a value for `:io.pedestal.http/enable-csrf`.

=== link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-content-type[`content-type`]

Always added.

=== link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-query-params[`query-params`]

Always added

=== link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-method-param[`method-param`]

Always added

=== link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-resource[`resource`]

Added when the service map has a value for `:io.pedestal.http/resource-path`.

=== link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-file[`file`]

Added when the service map has a value for `:io.pedestal.http/file-path`.

=== link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.secure-headers.html#var-secure-headers[`secure-headers`]

Added when the service map has a non-nil value for
`:io.pedestal.http/secure-headers` or when the service map does not
include the key `:io.pedestal.http/secure-headers` at all.

=== link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-router[`router`]

Always added.
