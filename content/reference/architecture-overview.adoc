== Motivation

We created Pedestal as a web framework. At the base, every web
framework must solve certain common problems:

1. Interpret incoming requests
2. Dispatch to application code
3. Produce a well-formed response

There is an unstated requirement that these all work in a variety of
deployment environments:

- Jar
- Exploded jar
- Container
- Unikernel

And with a variety of network connectors:

- Tomcat
- Jetty
- Undertow
- Netty
- nginx
- Vert.x
- etc.

One more dimension of complexity arises from the relevant styles of
application we want to support:

- API + SPA
- Streaming events
- Server-rendered pages

Solving these problems led us to an architecture that is based on
interceptors, the context map, and an adaptor to the HTTP connector.

=== Interceptors

In their original form, interceptors were a way to _reify the
callstack_ of request processing. That is to say, what would normally
be a layered jawbreaker of function closures became a sequence of data
structures. This model has allowed us to extract an increasing amount
of logic from the core framework into interceptors. For example,
routing is usually implemented as a core function of a web
framework. Because an interceptor can enqueue more interceptors to
execute, Pedestal implements routing as an ordinary interceptor.

Over time, we have moved most of the functionality of a typical web
framework into interceptors:

- Content negotiation
- Request body parsing
- Routing
- Parsing query parameters
- Assigning content type to the response

Application logic is also implemented in interceptors.

Interceptors are called in core.async go blocks, so one interceptor
may be called on a different thread than the next. All bindings will
be conveyed to each interceptor.

An interceptor may return a channel instead of the context map. In
that case, the channel is treated like a promise to deliver the
context map in the future. Once the channel delivers the context map,
the chain executor closes the channel.

The key protocol for interceptors is:

- link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.html#var-IntoInterceptor[`IntoInterceptor`]

=== Stock Interceptors

The link:../api/pedestal.service/index.html[`pedestal-service`] library includes a large set of interceptors
that are specialized for HTTP request handling.

See the following namespaces for stock interceptors:

- link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.body-params.html[`io.pedestal.http.body-params`]
- link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.content-negotiation.html[`io.pedestal.http.content-negotiation`]
- link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.cors.html[`io.pedestal.http.cors`]
- link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.csrf.html[`io.pedestal.http.csrf`]
- link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html[`io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares`]

See the following namespaces for routing interceptors:

- link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html[`io.pedestal.http.route`]
- link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.router.html[`io.pedestal.http.route.router`]

=== Context Bindings

Interceptors expect certain keys to be present in the context
map. These _context bindings_ are part of the contract between
provider and interceptors.

=== Chain Provider

Along with moving core logic into interceptors, we moved the HTTP
connection handling out of interceptor processing to create an
interface for the _chain provider_.

The chain provider sets up the initial context and queue of
interceptors. It starts execution.

Pedestal includes a servlet chain provider out of the box. It connects
any servlet container to an interceptor chain. The
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-create-servlet[`create-servlet`]
function orchestrates this work. This is strictly a convenience
function that takes a link:service-map[service map] of everything
needed to run an HTTP service.

It is possible to create other chain providers. The
https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/fast-pedestal[fast-pedestal
sample] shows how to do this with Jetty.

See the following namespaces for the HTTP chain provider:

- link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html[`io.pedestal.http`]

=== Network Connectors

The servlet chain provider immediately works with every HTTP server
that works with servlets. This allows many deployment scenarios.

Sometimes it is advantageous to work directly with a server by
implementing a custom chain provider.

The servlet chain provider (and main interface to network connectors) is in:
