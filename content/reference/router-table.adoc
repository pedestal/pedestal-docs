| Router | Performance | Scaling in # Routes | Limitations

|link:map-tree-router[Map Tree] (default after 0.5.2)
| Very fast
| Constant
| Applies when all routes are static. Falls back to prefix tree if any routes have path parameters or wildcards.

|link:prefix-tree-router[Prefix Tree] (default prior to 0.5.2)
| High performance, space efficient
| Log32(N)
| Wildcard routes always win over explicit paths in the same subtree. E.g., `/path/:wild` will always match, even if `/path/user` is defined

| link:linear-search-router[Linear Search]
| Lowest performance
| O(N)
| Routes are checked in order. Precedence is precise.
