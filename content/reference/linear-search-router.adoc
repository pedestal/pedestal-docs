== Motivation

Provides the user with the most control over routing outside of
implementing a custom router.

== Why use it?

You require precise control over routing and the routing performance
tradeoff is acceptable to your service.

== How to use it?

Add the key `:io.pedestal.http/router` to the service map with the
value `:linear-search`.

== Caveats

Routes requests in linear time. Slowest of Pedestal's router implementations.

== Additional Notes

Pedestal's first router implementation. 

Query and path contraints are used in routing decisions unlike the
link:prefix-tree-router[Prefix Tree Router] or link:map-tree-router[Map Tree Router].
