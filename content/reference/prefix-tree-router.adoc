== Motivation

Provide a performant router which is efficient in time and
space.

It's Modeled after link:https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter[httprouter].

== Why use it?

Most performant builtin router when dynamic routes (i.e, path
parameters, wildcards) are required. Routes requests in logarithmic time.

== How to use it?

Add the key `:io.pedestal.http/router` to the service map with the
value `:prefix-tree`.

== Caveats

Provides less control over routing. For example, Wild card routes
always win. The path `/foo/:bar` will always match over `/foo/baz`.

== Additional Notes

Like the link:map-tree-router[Map Tree Router], query and path
contraints are not used in routing decisions. They are only used to
invalidate a route match.
