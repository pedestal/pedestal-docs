Interceptors are the basic building block of features in Pedestal. The
core library provides interceptors that are generally useful for
creating HTTP web services. Applications augment those with their own
logic to handle.

An interceptor is a pair of unary functions. Each function is called
with a link:context-map[context map] and must return either a context
map or a channel that will deliver a context map.

Pedestal calls the `:enter` function on the way "in" to handling a
request. It calls the `:leave` function on the way back "out". This is
shown here for a single interceptor:

image::../images/guides/interceptors.png[]

Either the `:enter` or `:leave` function may be omitted without harm.

Logically speaking, interceptors form a stack. All the `:enter`
functions are called in order. Each one receives the content map and
returns a (possibly modified) context map. Once all the interceptors
have been called, the resulting context map gets passed through the
interceptors' `:leave` functions, but in reverse order, as shown here:

image::../images/guides/interceptor-stack.png[]

This isn't implemented as a regular Clojure or Java call stack. That
would not allow interceptors to return asynchronously. Pedestal
creates a kind of "virtual call stack" out of the interceptors' data
structures.

Pedestal keeps a queue of interceptors that still need to have their
`:enter` functions called. There is also a stack of interceptors whose
`:enter` functions have been called, but their `:leave` functions have
not. As such, the `:leave` functions are called in reverse order to
the `:enter` functions.

Both the queue and the stack reside in the context map. Since
interceptors can modify the context map, that means they can change
the plan of execution for the rest of the request! Interceptors are
allowed to enqueue more interceptors to be called, or they can
terminate the request.

=== Example

A basic interceptor is shown here.

[source,clojure]
----
(def attach-guid
  {:name ::attach-guid
   :enter (fn [context] (assoc context ::guid (java.util.UUID/randomUUID)))})
----

This interceptor has only the `:enter` function. Interceptors
executing after this one would be able to access the `::guid` key on the
context map.

[IMPORTANT]
.*Representing interceptors as maps*

--
Maps are commonly used to represent interceptors. While this is fine
for interceptors used in routing vectors, it can lead to issues in
other cases. More on that below.
--

[TIP]
.*Namespaced keywords*

--
It is a good practice to use namespaced keywords for data you attach
to the context map.
--

Another common usage of interceptors is to bracket processing of an
HTTP request with additional functionality. For example:

[source,clojure]
----
(def db-interceptor
  {:name ::database-interceptor
   :enter   (fn [context]
              (update context :request assoc ::database @database))
   :leave   (fn [context]
              (if-let [[op & args] (::tx-data context)]
                (do
                  (apply swap! database op args)
                  (assoc-in context [:request ::database] @database))
                context))})
----

Notice that this interceptor expects some other interceptor(s) to add
data to the context using the `::tx-data` key.

Interceptors are values but they are not required to be compile-time
values. Functions can close over state and return interceptors. Some
frequently-used built-ins work this way. (E.g.,
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.body-params.html#var-body-params[`body-params`].)

Here is an interceptor that accepts a connection string and attaches
the database connection to every request:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn attach-database [uri]
  (let [conn (db/connect uri)]
    {:name ::attach-database
     :enter #(assoc % ::connection conn ::db (d/db conn))}))
----

In addition to closing over the argument `uri`, we're using an
anonymous function for the `:enter` function here.

=== Interceptor Return Values

Interceptor functions must return values. Returning `nil` will cause
an internal server error.

An `:enter` or `:leave` function may return a context map directly. In
this case, processing continues with the next interceptor.

If the interceptor will take a long time to return a result, it may
also return a core.async channel. Pedestal will yield the thread and
wait for a value to be produced. Only one value will be consumed from
this channel, and it must be a context map.

A common usage for the second case is when making outbound service
requests. Use a `go` block as the return value, and Pedestal will
expect an asynchronous response.

[source,clojure]
----
(def third-party-auth
  {:name ::third-party-auth
   :enter (fn [context]
            (if (:session context)
              context
              (go
                (assoc context :auth-response (call-auth-system context))))})
----

=== IntoInterceptor

The protocol
link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.html#var-IntoInterceptor[`IntoInterceptor`]
represents anything that can be used as an interceptor. Pedestal extends that protocol to the following:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Type | Interpretation

| Map
| The `:enter`, `:leave`, and `:name` keys are used directly.

| Function
| The function is interpreted as a "handler". See below.

| List
| The list is evaluated and its result is used as an interceptor.

| Cons
| Same as List

| Symbol
| The symbol is resolved and its target is used as an interceptor.

| Var
| The var is dereferenced and its value is used as an interceptor.

|===

Most of these cases are provided to make routing syntax
easier.

Applications should mainly use the map form as shown in the
earlier examples when defining interceptors for routing
purposes.

=== Manipulating the interceptor queue

The queue of interceptors remaining to execute is held in the
link:context-map[context map]. This means that an interceptor can
enqueue other interceptors to be executed. In fact, this is how
routing works. The router is an interceptor that matches requests and
enqueues the desired interceptors when a route matches.

Use
link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.html#var-enqueue[`enqueue`]
to push more interceptors onto the queue.

Use
link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.html#var-terminate[`terminate`]
if processing should not continue.

[IMPORTANT]
.*Interceptor Records*

--
Interceptors that are explicitely enqueued by the application must
be defined using the `io.pedestal.interceptor/interceptor`
function. This function takes a value which extends `IntoInterceptor`
and returns an `Interceptor` Record.

This is not necessary when constructing interceptors used in routing
because interceptor representations are transformed to `Interceptor`
records during route expansion.
--

=== Handlers

A "handler" function is a special case of an interceptor. It plays the
role that a handler function plays in other web frameworks. Pedestal
treats the handler as a function that takes a link:request-map[request
map] and returns a link:response-map[response map].

A handler does _not_ have access to the full execution
context. Therefore, it cannot manipulate the interceptor queue or stack.

Because a handler takes one kind of thing (request) and returns a
different kind of thing (response), it can only be used in the last
position of a stack.

=== Error Handling

Pedestal supports defining interceptor-specific error handlers via the
`:error` key. Refer to the link:error-handling[Error Handling] reference for more details.
