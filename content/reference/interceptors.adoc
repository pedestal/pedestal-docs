== Interceptors

Interceptors are the basic building block of features in Pedestal. The
core library provides interceptors that are generally useful for
creating HTTP web services. Applications augment those with their own
logic to handle.

An interceptor is a pair of unary functions. Each function is called
with a link:context-map[context map] and must return either a context
map or a channel that will deliver a context map.

The `:enter` function is called when executing "into" the stack of
interceptors. The `:leave` function is called when stepping back "out
of" the stack of interceptors. This is shown here for a single interceptor:

image::../images/guides/interceptors.png[]

Either the enter or leave function may be omitted without harm.

The stack of interceptors represents the call stack of functions to
handle processing. As such, the `:leave` functions are called in
reverse order to the `:enter` functions, as shown here:

image::../images/guides/interceptor-stack.png[]

=== Example

A basic interceptor is shown here.

[source,clojure]
----
(def attach-guid
  {:name ::attach-guid
   :enter (fn [context] (assoc context ::guid (java.util.UUID/randomUUID)))})
----

This interceptor has only the `:enter` function. Interceptors
executing after this one would be able to access the `::guid` key on the
context map.

__NOTE: It is a good practice to use namespaced keywords for data you
attach to the context map.__

Another common usage of interceptors is to bracket processing of an
HTTP request with additional functionality. For example:

[source,clojure]
----
(def db-interceptor
  {:name ::database-interceptor
   :enter   (fn [context]
              (update context :request assoc ::database @database))
   :leave   (fn [context]
              (if-let [[op & args] (::tx-data context)]
                (do
                  (apply swap! database op args)
                  (assoc-in context [:request ::database] @database))
                context))})
----

Notice that this interceptor expects some other interceptor(s) to add
data to the context using the `::tx-data` key.

Interceptors are values but they are not required to be compile-time
values. Functions can close over state and return interceptors. Some
frequently-used built-ins work this way. (E.g.,
link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.body-params.html#var-body-params[`body-params`].)

Here is an interceptor that accepts a connection string and attaches
the database connection to every request:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn attach-database [uri]
  (let [conn (db/connect uri)]
    {:name ::attach-database
     :enter #(assoc % ::connection conn ::db (d/db conn))}))
----

In addition to closing over the argument `uri`, we're using an
anonymous function for the `:enter` function here.

=== Interceptor Return Values

Interceptor functions must return values. Returning `nil` will cause
an internal server error.

An `:enter` or `:leave` function may return a context map directly. In
this case, processing continues with the next interceptor.

If the interceptor will take a long time to return a result, it may
also return a core.async channel. Pedestal will yield the thread and
wait for a value to be produced. Only one value will be consumed from
this channel, and it must be a context map.

A common usage for the second case is when making outbound service
requests. Use a `go` block as the return value, and Pedestal will
expect an asynchronous response.

[source,clojure]
----
(def third-party-auth
  {:name ::third-party-auth
   :enter (fn [context]
            (if (:session context)
              context
              (go
                (assoc context :auth-response (call-auth-system context))))})
----

=== Manipulating the interceptor stack

The stack of interceptors remaining to execute is held in the
link:context-map[context map]. This means that an interceptor can
enqueue other interceptors to be executed. In fact, this is how
routing works. The router is an interceptor that matches requests and
enqueues the desired interceptors when a route matches.

Use
link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.html#var-enqueue[`enqueue`]
to push more interceptors onto the stack.

Use
link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.html#var-terminate[`terminate`]
if processing should not continue.

=== IntoInterceptor

The protocol
link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.html#var-IntoInterceptor[`IntoInterceptor`]
represents anything that can be used as an interceptor. Pedestal extends that protocol to the following:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Type | Interpretation

| Map
| The `:enter`, `:leave`, and `:name` keys are used directly.

| Function
| The function is interpreted as a "handler". See below.

| List
| The list is evaluated and its result is used as an interceptor.

| Cons
| Same as List

| Symbol
| The symbol is resolved and its target is used as an interceptor.

| Var
| The var is dereferenced and its value is used as an interceptor.

|===

Most of these cases are provided to make routing syntax
easier. Applications should mainly use the map form shown in the
earlier examples.

=== Handlers

A "handler" function is a special case of an interceptor. It plays the
role that a handler function plays in other web frameworks. Pedestal
treats the handler as a function that takes a link:request-map[request
map] and returns a link:response-map[response map].

A handler does _not_ have access to the full execution
context. Therefore, it cannot manipulate the interceptor stack.

Because a handler takes one kind of thing (request) and returns a
different kind of thing (response), it can only be used in the last
position of a stack.
