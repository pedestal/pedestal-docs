== Library

The library link:../api/pedestal.route/index.html[`pedestal-route`]
provides the core components to express routes and construct
routers. It can be used independently of the pedestal-service library.

== Routes vs. Routers

Pedestal distinguishes between routes and routers.

"Routes" are data that describe a structure of decisions to be made in
handling requests.

"Routers" are the functions (supplied as
link:interceptors[Interceptors]) that analyze incoming requests
against the routes.

Pedestal uses protocols to connect routes to routers. Either can be
varied independently.

== Routes

Routes are data used by routers. The "verbose syntax" is the form used
directly by routers. The "table" and "terse" syntaxes are convenient
forms that can be expanded into the verbose syntax.

Users are free to describe routes however they like, so long as the
data that reaches the router is in the "verbose syntax".

The built in syntaxes are expanded by
link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`expand-routes`]
polymorphically on the argument type:

|===
| Argument to `expand-routes` | Syntax used

| Vector
| Terse

| Set
| Table

| Map
| Verbose
|===


=== Verbose Syntax

The verbose syntax is a list of maps, with the following structure.

[source,clojure]
----
  {:route-name :new-user
   :app-name   :example-app        ; optional
   :path       "/user/:id/*blah"   ; like Ruby on Rails
                                   ; (catch-all route is "/*path")
   :method     :post               ; or :any, :get, :put, ...
   :scheme     :https              ; optional
   :host       "example.com"       ; optional
   :port       "8080"              ; optional
   :interceptors [...]             ; vector of interceptors to be enqueued on the context

   ;; Generated for path-matching:
   :path-re           #"/\Quser\E/([^/]+)/(.+)"
   :path-parts        ["user" :id :blah]
   :path-params       [:id :blah]
   :path-constraints  {:id "([^/]+)"
                       :blah "(.+)"}
   :query-constraints {:name #".+"
                       :search #"[0-9]+"}
   }
----

`:route-name` must be unique.

The keys `:path-re`, `:path-parts`, `:path-params`, and
`:path-constraints` are derived from the `:path`.

Users will not generally write routes directly in verbose format.

=== Table Syntax

Table syntax was introduced in release 0.5.0.

Table syntax is expanded by
link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`expand-routes`]
into the full (verbose) syntax shown above.

When the argument to
link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`expand-routes`]
is a *set*, it will be expanded using the table syntax.

In table syntax, each route is a vector of:

1. Path string
2. Verb. One of :any, :get, :put, :post, :delete, :patch, :options, :head
3. Handler or vector of interceptors
4. Optional route name clause
5. Optional constraint clause

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
  ["/user/:id/*blah"  :post  [...] :route-name :new-user :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]
----

The `:host`, `:port`, `:app-name`, and `:scheme` are provided in a map that applies to all routes in the list.

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
(route/expand-routes
  #{{:host "example.com" :scheme :https}
    ["/user/:id/*blah"  :post  [...] :route-name :new-user :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]})
----

When multiple routes use the same path, they must differ by both verb and route name.

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
    ["/user/:id"  :post new-user  :route-name :new-user  :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]
    ["/user/:id"  :get  view-user :route-name :view-user :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]
----

If the last interceptor in the chain has a name, or you supply a
symbol that resolves to a function or named interceptor, then the
route name will be derived from that.

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
    ;; Route names will be taken from the symbols
    (defn new-user [request] ,,,)
    (defn view-user [request] ,,,)

    (route/expand-routes
      #{["/user/:id"  :post [,,, `new-user]  :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]
        ["/user/:id"  :get  [,,, `view-user] :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]})

    ;; Route names will be taken from the interceptors
    (def new-user-intc {:name :new-user :enter (fn [context] ,,,)})
    (def view-user-intc {:name :view-user :enter (fn [context] ,,,)})

    (route/expand-routes
      #{["/user/:id"  :post [,,, new-user-intc]  :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]
        ["/user/:id"  :get  [,,, view-user-intc] :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]})
----

=== Terse Syntax

Terse syntax is expanded by
link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`expand-routes`]
into the full (verbose) syntax shown above.

When the argument to
link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`expand-routes`]
is a *vector*, it will be expanded using the terse syntax.

In the terse format, a route table is a vector of nested vectors. Each
top-level vector describes an "application". The application vector
contain the following elements:

- (Optional) A keyword identifying the application by name
- (Optional) A URL scheme
- (Optional) A host name
- One or more nested vectors specifying routes

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
;; Application vector with one route vector (which has one route)
[[:hello-world :http "example.com"
 ["/hello-world" {:get hello-world}]]]
----


Route vectors can be nested arbitrarily deep. Each vector adds a path
segment. The nesting structure of the route vectors maps to the
hierarchic tree structure of the routes.

Each route vector contains the following:

1. A path segment. This must begin with a slash.
2. (Optional) Interceptor metadata for the verb map.
3. (Optional) Constraint metadata for the verb map.
4. A verb map
5. Zero or more child route vectors

The allowed keys in a verb map are:

- :get
- :put
- :post
- :delete
- :any

The value of each key is either a handler function or a list of interceptors.

Each verb in the verb map defines a route on the path. This example
defines four routes.

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
[[:hello-world :http "example.com"
 ["/order" {:get list-orders
            :post create-order}
   ["/:id" {:get view-order
            :put update-order}]]]
----

Interceptor metadata applies to every route in the verb map. In this
example `load-order-from-db` applies to both the `:get` and `:put`
routes for the path "/order/:id"

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
[[:hello-world :http "example.com"
 ["/order" {:get list-orders
            :post create-order}
   ["/:id" ^{:interceptors [load-order-from-db]
             :constraints  {:id #"[0-9]+"}}
           {:get view-order
            :put update-order}]]]
----

(Recall that metadata is attached to the _next_ data structure
read. The metadata with constraints and interceptors will be attached
to the verb map.)

If multiple routes have the same handler, you will need to distinguish
them by providing route names. (This is necessary so URL generation
knows which route to use.) A route name is a keyword that goes in the
first position of an interceptor vector in the verb map. In the
following example, both POST routes have the same handler. We provide
the keywords `:post-without-id` and `:post-by-id` to distinguish the
routes.

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
[[:hello-world :http "example.com"
 ["/order" {:get  list-orders
            :post [:post-without-id create-order]}
   ["/:id" {:get  query-order
            :post [:post-by-id create-order]}]]]
----

== Routers

When your application starts a Pedestal service with link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-create-servlet[`create-servlet`] or link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-create-server[`create-server`], Pedestal creates a router, using the following keys from the service map:

|===
| Key | Meaning

| `:io.pedestal.http/routes` | Routes as described above
| `:io.pedestal.http/router` | Key to select a router, or a function that constructs a router
|===

When the value of `:io.pedestal.http/router` is a keyword, it selects
one of the built in routers:

- `:map-tree`
- `:prefix-tree`
- `:linear-search`

|===
| Router | Performance | Scaling in # Routes | Limitations

|Map Tree (default after 0.5.2)
| Very fast
| Constant
| Applies when all routes are static. Falls back to prefix tree if any routes have path parameters or wildcards.

|Prefix Tree (default prior to 0.5.2)
| High performance, space efficient
| Log32(N)
| Wildcard routes always win over explicit paths in the same subtree. E.g., `/path/:wild` will always match, even if `/path/user` is defined

| Linear Search
| Lowest performance
| O(N)
| Routes are checked in order. Precedence is precise.
|===

=== Custom Router

When the value of `:io.pedestal.http/router` is a function, that
function is used to construct a router. The function must take one
argument: the collection of fully expanded routes. It must return
something that satisfies the
link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.router.html#var-Router[`Router`]
protocol.
